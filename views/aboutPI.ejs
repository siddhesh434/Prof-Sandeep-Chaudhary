          contributed as an academician, researcher, and industry expert in
          structural engineering and sustainable construction. His research
          focuses on the microstructural behavior of building materials,
          sustainable building products, and large-structure analysis. His work
          has resulted in
          <span class="highlight">two patents</span> and the first technology
          transfer at IIT Indore.
        </p>

          He is part of an interdisciplinary team that secured an
          <span class="highlight">INR 100-crore grant</span> to establish a
          <span class="highlight">Technology Innovation Hub (TIH)</span>. His
          international collaborations include a recent invitation from the
          Government of the Russian Federation to develop a world-class research
          lab at NPI, Russia, leading a project on
          <span class="highlight">carbon-neutral technologies</span> for
          recycling industrial fuel waste into functional geopolymer materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prof. Chaudhary has been actively involved in prestigious national and
          international committees. He currently serves as the Secretary of the
